## üìä Database Testing

### Direct Database Queries
```bash
# Open database shell
make shell-db

# Test queries in PostgreSQL:
```

```sql
-- Check data loading
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organizations;  -- Should return 3
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;          -- Should return 8  
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM properties;     -- Should return 6
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM work_logs;      -- Should return 15+

-- Test organization isolation
SELECT 
  o.name as organization,
  COUNT(p.id) as properties,
  COUNT(wl.id) as work_logs
FROM organizations o
LEFT JOIN properties p ON o.id = p.organization_id
LEFT JOIN work_logs wl ON o.id = wl.organization_id
GROUP BY o.id, o.name;

-- Test recent activity
SELECT 
  wl.title,
  p.name as property,
  wl.completed_at,
  wl.total_cost
FROM work_logs wl
JOIN properties p ON wl.property_id = p.id
ORDER BY wl.completed_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Test cost analysis
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('month', completed_at) as month,
  COUNT(*) as jobs,
  SUM(total_cost) as total_cost,
  AVG(total_cost) as avg_cost
FROM work_logs
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', completed_at)
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

### Data Integrity Tests
```sql
-- Check foreign key constraints
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as orphaned_work_logs
FROM work_logs wl
LEFT JOIN properties p ON wl.property_id = p.id
WHERE p.id IS NULL;  -- Should return 0

-- Verify audit trail
SELECT 
  entity_type,
  action,
  COUNT(*) as events
FROM audit_events
GROUP BY entity_type, action
ORDER BY entity_type, action;

-- Check user permissions
SELECT 
  u.email,
  o.name as organization,
  r.name as role,
  r.permissions
FROM users u
JOIN user_organization_roles uo ON u.id = uo.user_id
JOIN organizations o ON uo.organization_id = o.id
JOIN roles r ON uo.role_id = r.id
WHERE u.is_active = true AND uo.is_active = true;
```
